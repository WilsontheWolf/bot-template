A boilerplate bot by @WilsontheWolf and @Chicken

This bot was made to be used for us and is not really designed for people who don't know 
how to use Discord.js. If you want a bot that has explanations and more understandable 
proper code I would recommend [guidebot](https://github.com/anidiotsguide/guidebot)
which this bot is highly based off.
